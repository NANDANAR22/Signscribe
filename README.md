Project Description: Our project aims to create a sign language detection software by detecting the hand gestures and converting it into text. It helps to break the barriers of communication between deaf people and non sign language users.


The Problem statement: To develop a software inorder to detect and convert hand gestures to alphabets.It helps to break the barriers of communication between sign language and non sign language users.

The Solution: We uses git and github,also mediapipe,opencv,streamlit, tensorflow and also ASL Dataset for the whole project.A software which recognize sign language is develop and it will convert to alphabets.SignScribe solves this by allowing users to upload images of hand gestures, which are then processed by a trained AI model to display the corresponding alphabet, making communication intuitive and inclusive.
